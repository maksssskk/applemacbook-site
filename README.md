## MacBook Pro M5 Feature Grid with GSAP Animations 🚀
A high-fidelity landing page section inspired by Apple’s MacBook Pro marketing. This project combines advanced CSS Grid structures with professional GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) sequences to create a premium, interactive user experience.

## 🎯 Project Overview
The goal was to master the Bento Grid design pattern while implementing industry-standard animation workflows. The layout adapts a non-standard grid to house high-resolution media and dynamic content layers.

## Key Features
Asymmetric Bento Grid: A custom grid system built with grid-template-rows and grid-column spans to create a rhythmic, modern look.

GSAP Powered Motion: Custom animation timelines that handle element entrance, hover states, and smooth property transitions.

Integrated Media Layers: Background assets managed via absolute positioning and object-fit: cover to ensure visual depth.

Advanced CSS Artistry: Gradient borders and text effects achieved through complex background-clip and masking techniques.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
GSAP (GreenSock): Used for high-performance, timeline-based animations.

JavaScript (DOM): Advanced manipulation for interactive states and event handling.

CSS3 (Grid & Flexbox): For the structural foundation and responsive alignment.

HTML5: Clean, semantic structure for accessibility and SEO.

## 🧠 What I Learned
Animation Choreography: Using GSAP Timelines to sequence multiple elements instead of basic CSS transitions.

Grid Orchestration: How to span elements across multiple rows and columns to match high-end design mocks.

Performance Optimization: Efficiently handling background images and layout shifts for a 60fps experience.

Layered Compositing: Managing z-index and stacking contexts to place UI components over dynamic media.
